# Car_Plate_Detector_With_OCR
The proposed License Plate Detection System is structured into three main stages: locating the license plate, extracting individual characters, and performing text recognition. 
The first stage applies a series of image processing techniques to accurately locate and isolate the license plate region. 
In the second stage, individual characters are extracted from the isolated plate. 
Finally, an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module, implemented using a Voting Mechanism that combines multiple classifiers, is used to enhance text recognition accuracy.
